# PowerShell
A collection of scripts I've written to make managing an educational, primarily Windows, infrastructure easier via PowerShell.

Working examples include:

Active Directory - Performing mass password resets.

Active Directory - Moving computers around based on naming prefixes.

Active Directory - Archiving and disabling devices that have not been on the network.

Active Directory - Creating distribution lists and sorting students for e-mail groups.

Office 365 - Setting the 'Send As' (Trustee) setting for all users.

Windows Server - Checking for pending restarts and scheduling them.

I also have provided some basic examples of other items I typically come across:

Reading a CSV and using the input line by line.

Connecting to a Cisco switch and perform a shut / no shut along with disabling inline power for resetting PoE devices.
